## Own modifications
Adopted from tudurom's fork of his personal startpage, I just changed the fonts and colours to my liking and to work better with my small screen. 

## Original Readme
My current startpage, made by converting ix's webpage styles to scss, adding my color scheme, links and a search bar.
